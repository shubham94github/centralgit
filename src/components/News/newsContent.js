	US sportswear and footwear retailer Foot Locker is spending 1.1 billion dollars to buy two companies as it looks to simultaneously accelerate its Asia-Pacific expansion and solidify its positioning in North America.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	The New York-based company announced Monday plans to buy Eurostar, the parent company of US-based athletic footwear and apparel retailer WSS, for 750 million dollars.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	WSS is focused on the “large and fast-growing” Hispanic consumer demographic, with 93 off-mall stores in key markets across California, Texas, Arizona, and Nevada.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	In its fiscal year 2020, the company generated approximately 425 million dollars, with a three-year revenue CAGR of approximately 15 percent.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Foot Locker said it will “benefit from WSS’s differentiated market position and complementary customer base and real estate portfolio”.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<b>Strategic foothold in Japan</b>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	In a separate announcement on the same day, Foot Locker said it plans to buy Text Trading Company K.K., the owner and licenser of Japan-based streetwear retailer atmos, for 360 million dollars.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	The retailer has 49 stores globally, including 39 in Japan, which operate under the atmos banner and atmos pink, its women’s brand. It generated approximately 175 million dollars in revenue in its fiscal year 2020, more than 60 percent of which was generated through digital channels.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Foot Locker said the acquisition will accelerate its global reach with “a highly strategic foothold in Japan”.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Richard A. Johnson, chairman and CEO of Foot Locker, said the two acquisitions reflect the company’s commitment to its growth strategy and “engaging with new and incremental consumers”.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	“With our ongoing investments in the business, we are confident in our ability to continue creating significant long-term value for our shareholders, consumers, vendor partners, and other stakeholders,” Johnson said.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Foot Locker said it expects to close both deals at the end of the third quarter.

	<P16>
	Retail has been around for centuries. So before we look into the future, let’s start by looking at the history of retail.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	</P16>
	<ul>
		<li>
			In the 1770-1800s, Mom and Pop shops ruled the world.  Small, family owned businesses specializing in things like bakeries, shoe stores and even drug stores were in every city.
		</li>
		<li>
			By the mid 1800s-early 1900s department stores began to appear. These stores like Macy’s and Sears started to showcase the value of customer experience by showcasing demos and even events bringing retail to a different level.

		</li>
		<li>
			In the 1950s, we began to see the emergence of credit cards and shopping malls which focused on convenience and ease in paying for things but also a place to be and hang out.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the 1960s, the very first Walmart appeared creating an interest in big box stores that focused more on self service and efficiency.
		</li>
		<li>
			By the early 2000s, Amazon led the way for online shopping creating the opportunity for people to shop any time of day or night, read reviews, do price comparison and more.
		</li>
		<li>
			As technology increased, in 2007, Facebook and soon other social media sites disrupted the retail space allowing retailers to talk directly to their customers, provide customer service through social media and eventually directly market and sell to the exact consumer they were looking for.
		</li>
		<li>
			And now we look at today, 2021 and beyond – after a global pandemic – where we’re seeing a large shift to personalized customer experiences that offer efficiency, ease, convenience and care with new technologies like AI and conversational AI.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<P16>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>AI in Retail Today</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
	During the pandemic the data we once knew was no longer valuable.  [It used to be that] pizzas were being ordered at a certain time of day and at Costco we knew when the big Gatorades and the juice boxes would be ordered. You didn’t have kids coming out of high school for burgers and fries the way they always did which means there was also a supply side challenge.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	So AI became essential in helping businesses understand what was going on around them. What schools were open, what churches were closed, all of that became so informative for store managers to figure out how to rationalize some of their offerings, how to change their inventories, how to deal with the hours that they would even be open for business,” said Gwen Morrison, Senior Advisor at the Open Voice Network and former CEO of WPP’s Global Retail Practice.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Shilp Agarwal, CEO at Blutag added “People started reordering using their Alexa device and they actually loved it, but with that said, they also did not realize that they could actually do that with their favorite brands that are not on Amazon. So that’s the education piece that we have been working with brands. A lot of the direct to consumer retail brands that don’t have a presence on Amazon, we let them know that your customers can still shop on Alexa and on Google assistant but directly through your website.”
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>How to Create a Great Customer Journey with Voice</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
	With this global change, retailers had to find new ways to reach, interact and sell to their customers.  But for brands, they started to realize it wasn’t just about reaching their customers where they were at, but also where they were at along their journey.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Richard Warzecha, an Independent Consultant for Best Buy shared his views on how Best Buy is doing it. “So many people are looking for better quality and what are the right use cases for retail? And I think where we need to go with this is to look at the view on the overall shopping experience and shopping journey for a customer. I think it’s tempting within the retail space to think that it’s all about the transaction, but what we like to do at Best Buy is to look at the many stages of shopping.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	There are exploration stages like looking for wireless headphones or a refrigerator and what do I need to learn in order to make a better decision? There’s the next stage, which is sort of the choosing stage, which is where, of all these different possibilities, how do we get down to the one that I want to purchase? And then once we get at that stage, we have to look at trends to actually make that as easy to sequence as possible.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	And then once you’ve transacted, there’s also the stage of, how am I going to get this thing? When’s it going to show up? How do I keep track of the shipments? And if I get it, if I happen to want to return it, what do I do?  Then we ask ourselves, where along that whole overall journey is there opportunity for voice to be [more efficient and helpful].
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Best Buy has gone completely multichannel with our voice perspective, with our voice experience, which means we want to be where our customers are, so that if you add something to your cart via the website or a voice you could, or mobile, it’s all the same part and you should be able to do it. If I add something to voice, I could purchase it via a website and vice versa. And we’ve delivered on that recently and now we continue to polish that and look at the journey to see where there are places for us to improve.”
		<br/>
		<br/>
	The concept of conversational AI can include chatbots or voice technology.  And voice technology can not just include a voice skill, but a voice can be added to a website, a mobile app, a device and more.  “I think there’s currently this big focus around just creating the most efficient experience for me to come to a website, find what I need and ultimately purchase it,” added Collin Borns, Business Development at Speechly.  “So really trying to create that efficiently, from discovery to ultimately purchasing, is a big topic that we’re seeing within the retail and e-commerce space. So I think in e-comm, that’s a very sort of natural fit for a voice interface where you can take the value that we’ve seen so far from voice, which is, efficient command and control or efficiently getting a task done and bring some of that to the e-commerce space to ultimately realize that goal.”
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>What it Means to Build a Great Experience for Customers</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
	And as mentioned before, retail is no longer just about sales, it’s about creating an experience as well.  “To understand ROI, yes you can track sales, but then on the flip side, and this is kind of what we tell our brands all the time and the companies we work with, it’s no longer all about the sale.  It’s also about creating an emotional connection with someone, so that you gain brand loyalty,” said Heidi Bailey,VP, Futures & A.I. at The Integer Group.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	“It’s about creating an experience. And so you shouldn’t just be tracking ROI, but you should be looking at what kind of experiences the conversational AI is giving you in terms of an emotional connection. Is it increasing your brand affinity? Is it increasing your loyalty? People may not be buying right that second, but maybe they do a few days later because the experience was so great. So always look at those two things. It’s not just all about ROI. It’s also about how you measure how it affects the rest of your brand.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	We have a proprietary methodology [at Integer] where we’re marrying the emotional aspect alongside sales with some of the analysis that we do for our clients. We’re pulling in both quantitative and qualitative measures in order to get there, we weigh them, we score them and then ultimately you can then understand how sales or emotion or brand loyalty or any kind of brand affinity metrics are actually affecting your sales and correlating them and adding coefficients to them. So that is something that we also do on the backend,” said Bailey.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	“It’s always been important to have that connection with your customer,” added Agarwal. “But I think today in this new era, personalized connection with your customer is even more important than ever. So how do you make sure that when someone walks into the store, you can have the store design reflect your brand’s personality? How do you make sure that reflects when somebody’s shopping from home or in their car and a voice [of your own] is something that really brings that out. It makes it a lot more human where you can actually have that connection. So I think those aspects are pretty game changing when it comes to voice.”
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>Real Use Cases in Retail</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
	How do you create connections in a real use case?  What does that look like when it comes to voice and AI for retail?
		<br/>
		<br/>
	For Agarwal, “if it’s something that’s a reordering of a replenishable item, a lot of our top customer categories are groceries, baby and beauty. The big reasons for these categories to be popular for voice is a lot of repeat orders and they don’t require a visual.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	So now people can just say, Hey, reorder my coffee from Don Pablo coffee. And essentially it knows who you are. And it’s able to grab that previous order that you did, and use Amazon pay essentially to place that order.  And it’s a completely friction-free method. So once people get used to that aspect of it, it is really hard to take that habit back, because now they’ve experienced that aspect of being able to do that with the brand.”
		<br/>
		<br/>
	“If you look at the grocery side of things, this is where I think approaching voice as a feature can unlock some of these different types of use cases,” said Borns. “We work with this company called the S group, they’re the largest retailer in the Nordics and we helped them create this voice enabled grocery list.  So if you could picture just being able to list out, eggs, ham, cheese, Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, pizza, whatever it may be, but then let’s say there was an error on one of those objects in the middle, or let’s say you wanted to make a slight change to the cheese. I don’t want Feta cheese. I want cheddar cheese. If you could imagine trying to do that purely from a conversation point of view, again, we’re talking about a very sophisticated and challenging sort of user experience, that might not even be the best user experience and [therefore just having a one way vocal conversation like we created may be best.]”
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Morrison added, “I can even envision a shopping experience that starts at home where I can actually kind of tour the store. And I can say, I’d like to see 4th of July special napkins, what’s available today?  We could look at voice as being the driver to say, take me to the right areas of this e-commerce platform that becomes more visually three-dimensional. That allows me to say, turn this way. I want to see what’s over there. We haven’t gotten to that point yet, but that’s how I see voice as being an essential component to a much more interesting aspirational shopping experience. It may start in the home. I may click and collect. I might get it there, I might say, but now I want to see more of what was in that other area. And there’s a reason for me to go into that store.”
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>How to Integrate AI and Brick and Mortar Stores Together</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Does AI mean brick and mortar stores are dead?  It’s not about one or the other, it’s about connecting the two.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	“When it comes to voice, there’s a lot of other aspects that make a lot of sense as well. So for example, we work very closely with the Alexa print team, and it’s a really cool feature and it’s getting a lot more usage now because more people are home. Essentially, what it does is that it gives you the ability to print anything on your printer just by speaking to your Alexa device. So, for example, if you want to print a coupon to Bloomingdale’s, for example, you can just ask Alexa for that coupon. And it says, ‘Oh, I found this coupon for 20% off for next Mother’s Day. Would you like to print it?’  All you have to do is say yes, and it prints it for you. So whether you’re waiting for a sale or you’re walking out of the door, going into the store quickly, ask your device, ‘Hey, is there a coupon?’and if it responds back, “Sorry, I don’t know that that means,” the retailer does not have any coupons or sales available. And now with our company having more than 500 retailers we’ve worked with, we do see more and more people getting very used to asking that question and using voice,” said Agarwal.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Bailey added a retail concept she’d love to see. “So if you think about a fashion stylist for instance, you could have a stylist conversational AI and they’re asking you what type of clothes you want or what styles you like and they’re putting some interesting things in front of you instead of you just buying it. So let’s say for instance it’s for Nordstrom’s and there’s a Nordstrom’s 10 minutes from my house. What, if I could try this on, can the chatbot or voicebot now switch gears and essentially book an appointment with me at Nordstrom’s to come in and try the outfit?
		<br/>
		<br/>
	And when I get there, the outfit’s already waiting in the waiting room. I don’t have to try to find clothes. I try them on. If I like them, I buy them. And so you’re seamlessly kind of connecting the digital and physical spaces and you’re having a great connection with the consumer. You also then potentially eliminate some of your returns. I think it’s a really interesting concept and one that I’ve been exploring to see how we can make that a reality.”
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Morrison shared a voice skill she found interesting called Send Me a Sample.  “I asked Alexa, send me a sample. It said, what would you like? I just said, well, what do you have? There wasn’t much of a visual that I could see, so I said how about something in beauty? And then I did get an Estée Lauder sample of something that is on its way to me now. So we’ll see what it is. It’s fun to put a little surprise and delight into retail. That’s what retail is all about to begin with.”
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>How to Win with Brand</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
	If you’re creating a real connection with your customer, that also includes showcasing your brand and who you are through conversational AI and voice. It’s hard to connect with a brand if they all sound the same.  Creating a seamless journey is a huge part of it, but making it sound and feel like your brand is equally as important.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	“I think voice is incredibly important. Think about how much time a brand spends creating their brand colors and logos. When you are starting a social channel, you have to have a certain feel and look, and your images kind of roll up into that. And there’s a lot of thought, effort and investment that goes into creating a whole brand environment,” said Bailey.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	“And so when you think about voice and how it’s starting to fit into that, it deserves the same kind of level of investment and strategic thinking. It becomes essentially your brand. If you are a brand that is more serious, you wouldn’t want to create a chatbot or a voice skill that talks about humor or that’s humorous, or has funny answers, because it’s a disconnect between what your brand stands for. So always look at your purpose, always look at your values, always look at how did you develop the brand in the first place, again, looking at the gap, where does a voice fit in and then find out where that voice and tone of voice should be in order to kind of facilitate a really great experience for customers.”

		<br/>
		<br/>
	Carissa Merrill, an Independent Consultant for Best Buy added, “I really do think that the foundation of having an inclusive product and inclusive system really needs to be built intentionally from the ground up. [It’s important for companies to] live those values of inclusion, as well as build really inclusive teams and having those teams build inclusive products. And then also getting a [diverse group of] active user buy-in, getting active engagement and feedback.”
		<br/>
		<br/>
	“We like to say that we don’t create products for our customers. We create products with our customers, “ added Warzecha.  “Our lead researchers and team ensure that we not only include looking at age and gender within our participants but also sexual orientation, gender identity and eventually cognitive capabilities too. [People tend to] make assumptions of how it’s going to go over with their customer base [so it’s better to] expose some of those blind spots [by having your] participant panel be representative of your [vast] customer base too.”
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>One Tip To Building Your AI for Retail</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
	If you’re a retailer, voice is here and will be the next part of history we create for the retail industry.  Here’s one tip from each of our retail experts to help you get started and thrive in this space.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Carissa Merrill, an Independent Consultant for Best Buy: “[It’s important to remember to continue to] build trust again and again with a holistic approach. Start small and iterate, iterate, iterate, because there’s so much to be learned and every use case, every retailer, every customer is different, so get something out there and keep experimenting.”
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Richard Warzecha, an Independent Consultant for Best Buy: “Get the experience on a device as soon as possible. This is a new medium. It’s not like web or print. There are plenty of no-code or low-code options out there, so just get started.”
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Collin Borns, Business Development at Speechly: “Ask yourself, is a voice assistant the best use for my business in terms of voice technology, whether that’s a general voice assistant skill or action on an Alexa or Google, or whether that’s an independent type voice assistant, or would my company or business benefit more from just voice as a feature?”
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Heidi Bailey,VP, Futures & A.I. at The Integer Group: “I would love to share two. First, before you start building a conversational AI or any kind of AI experience, make sure that it has an actual purpose, make sure that it integrates with your brand, it ladders up to what your brand stands for and ultimately also what you’re trying to achieve. Because if consumers have a bad experience somewhere, it doesn’t quite match your brand or they’re like, what is this?  That’s how you start to lose brand loyalty. Most important of all, bring in lots of people from the company in different areas. Typically it’s the data or the AI team who is building these types of experiences, but you never know, there might be some things the creative team brings that they really think are necessary and notice gaps where they could help improve it.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Second, ask yourself, is what you’re doing driving behavior change?  This goes back again to measuring emotion. You have to benchmark it and you have to understand, where is your brand in the market today? What is the perception of your brand and of your products?
		<br/>
		<br/>
	You could look at what consumers are talking about? What are they saying? What are they saying about your brand? Look at your reviews on Amazon, look at all those things and potentially do some natural language processing on top of that. What exactly are people saying, what is the emotion? What is the need? Where is that gap? Where’s that friction? And then you start to build something smart, because you are essentially eliminating this gap or this friction for consumers making the experience more powerful and more personal for them because you’re actually listening to them. And you continue to monitor your brand affinity – are my affinity metrics going up, is my net sentiment in social going up, are people giving me more positive reviews on Amazon, on Google, etc.? When you’re measuring these things consistently, you can start to understand behavior change, but at the same time become smart about how you shift and change your conversational AI to take into account all the new things that are happening in the market.”
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Gwen Morrison, Senior Advisor at the Open Voice Network and former CEO of WPP’s Global Retail Practice: “Learn about what the possibilities are. I wouldn’t initiate a project that’s for the sake of integrating a voice strategy into the center. I would always say, how is voice an extension of what we’re trying to do? How does it become an enhancement and how do we learn? Always considering, well, what’s the voice component of this use case, and then be realistic about whether if what you’re talking about for the future can really be deployed today, or what are we doing with our technology partners to assess, how reliable is it going to be, because the thing you don’t want is to set up a situation where you’re frustrating a shopper, because voice isn’t working. I’ll give you an example of going into a mass retailer and you see a kiosk and you can type in what you’re looking for or use your voice. And of course, it’s easier to use my voice. I don’t want to put everything down and try to key in something, but if I use my voice and it doesn’t work, [that could be a frustrating experience] so keep experimenting with that [before you release it to the public].”
		<br/>
		<br/>
	Shilp Agarwal, CEO at Blutag: “Start sooner rather than later because what’s happening is that I think a lot of brands are going through this aspect saying that, oh, voice isn’t that big right now, we have to hit these numbers and our KPIs, and voice is not something that’s playing that role, because the number of users that we get on mobile or web are a lot more than voice at the moment. But I think it’s just a very wrong way to think about it. We have customers that are getting revenue from voice. In fact there’s one company we brought on board three months ago, getting 30,000 interactions through the voice assistant every month.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	And now what’s happening is that their customers are so aware of these voice apps that now the vendor has the ability to send them a reminder like, ‘Hey, are you running out of your coffee? Do you want to reorder it?’ All these bands are going to have such a massive advantage a year, two years down the line because they’ll have tens of thousands or more of these voice ads that have been enabled across all devices and they already have that connection with their customers.”

	In Émile Zola’s 1883 novel Au Bonheur des Dames, the department store that forms the backdrop for the intrigues expands steadily as the story unfolds. If Zola were writing today, it would probably be dressing the windows for a closing down sale. Department stores are in retreat across the world.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	The “cathedrals of commerce” erected at great expense in the 19th and 20th centuries are widely regarded as a concept whose time has passed — hobbled by their high fixed costs and unable to compete with the “endless aisle” of the internet. Covid-19 has only accelerated this decline. Earlier this year, Debenhams pulled down the shutters on the last of its 124 UK stores, marking the end of more than 200 years of retail heritage. Dozens of independent operators have closed. Even John Lewis, regarded as the most financially conservative of the main UK chains, has shut eight of its 50 stores since the pandemic and announced a further eight closures.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	That has left large holes in the towns and cities of a country that embraced the department store like few others.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	“They were known as anchor stores and they gave places character and status,” says Professor Cathy Parker at the Institute of Place Management at Manchester Metropolitan University. “Having something like a Harvey Nichols put you at the top of the retail hierarchy.” In shopping malls, they typically pay low per-square-foot rents in recognition of their role as drivers of footfall; other tenants benefit from the pulling power of department stores that offer everything from beauty to homewares.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	That same principle operates in city and town centres, where councils in the UK have gone to great lengths to retain department stores as tenants despite the condition of local government finances. And the current evidence suggests that the largest department stores in the most prestigious locations will survive. At the time of writing, the group that includes London’s Selfridges store was up for sale with a £4bn potential price tag — more than six times what its current owners paid for it in 2003. Meanwhile, some others will be converted to serve alternative business purposes, including leisure, office space, residential and hospitality — especially where they occupied standalone buildings in prominent locations.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	For example, the Jenners building on Edinburgh’s Princes Street — ironically owned by the one of Europe’s richest ecommerce tycoons — is to become a hotel with a smaller department store on its lower floors. Rackhams in Birmingham will also become a mixed-use facility, incorporating office space, retail, hospitality and public space. In Exeter, the former House of Fraser is to reopen as a hotel. But such changes of use will not work everywhere, even after the UK government recently changed the law to remove some planning obstacles. Michael Murray, who oversees property strategy at Frasers Group, says the cost of conversion is often prohibitive, especially where commercial property prices are lower.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	“You end up with effectively a negative land value as a result.” Mark Williams, at regeneration specialist Rivington Hark, says that if you drew a line from Bristol to The Wash, in England’s East Anglia region, “north of that line you will probably need some kind of local authority intervention to make the sums add up . . . Doing something like a hotel conversion is very challenging even if the land values are enough to make it worthwhile.” Tony Brown, who ran the regional department store chain Beales until its collapse in early 2020, agrees with Murray that the model can still work — if it is radically rethought. For him, that means smaller stores — “not much more than 30,000 square feet” — and lower costs.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	“The capital intensity of the old department store model was simply too great,” he says, due to the high operating costs and the working capital needed to maintain levels of own-bought stock. Brown has resurrected the Beales name, opening stores in Poole and Peterborough, but with key differences.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	The ground-floor “beauty hall” — long considered a department store must-have — is gone. “The economics of cosmetics, in particular, were dreadful,” he explains, citing the weak profit margins and the onerous conditions imposed by beauty brands which are now under pressure from online-only upstarts. A less visible but equally important change is that almost all revenue in the new stores comes from commissions on sales made by brand partners from their in-store sales areas. This avoids tying up capital in stock — the brands own the inventory — and the need to employ armies of buyers and merchandisers.  Brown says the model is scalable and he plans, eventually, to have five stores in provincial towns and cities. But he acknowledges that the rapid store rollouts of the past are well and truly over.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	“I don’t think you’ll ever see a 150-store chain like Debenhams again. But there will be operators like us, with a small number of smaller stores.” For Parker, town centres need to be less focused on retail. “In future, we need to build space that is more adaptable, otherwise we will keep ending up with these white elephant buildings.”
